Tones in Mandarin Chinese

- listen to the examples
- a syllable can have different meanings depending on which tone it's pronounced with
- tones are often hard for non-native speakers
- however, you ALREADY use tones!
  - tone 1: like singing a high note
  - tone 2: like saying "huh?" very skeptically (leave these till later?)
  - tone 3: like singing a low note
  - tone 4: like declaring something emphatically "done!"

Some HVPT disambiguation exercises
